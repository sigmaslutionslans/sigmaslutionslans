Short-term loans can be a lifeline in an emergency, whether you’re facing a medical crisis or need to make a car repair.

We’ve rounded up our four picks for best short-term loans, highlighting what makes each stand out. While there’s no universally accepted definition of a short-term loan, we’ve defined it here as a loan with terms of 12 months or less.

It’s important to keep in mind that some of these lenders may offer short-term loans with relatively high interest rates — but the annual percentage rates, or APRs, are still lower than the typical payday loan.
