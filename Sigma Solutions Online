Best for early access to your paycheck: Earnin

Why Earnin stands out: Earnin is an app that may be a useful alternative to a payday loan because it promises no fees and interest. (You can “tip” an optional amount.) To begin, members of Earnin can only take out $100 per pay period, but that limit may increase over time.

You’ll repay your advance by allowing Earnin to withdraw the money owed from your bank account on payday.

How to qualify — Not everyone will qualify to use Earnin, even if you’re employed. In order to be eligible, you must send more than 50% of your paycheck to direct deposit in your checking account, have a consistent pay schedule (such as weekly, bi-weekly or monthly), and have a consistent working location or participate in a digital timekeeping system to track your working hours.
Balance Shield features — Earnin also offers “Balance Shield Alerts” to notify you if your checking account dips below a specified amount and “Balance Shield Cash Outs,” which advance money if your account balance drops below $10
