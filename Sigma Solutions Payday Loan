Best for people with little or no credit history: Oportun

Why Oportun stands out: Getting a loan may be difficult if you haven’t built strong credit yet or don’t have a credit history. Oportun may be a solution since it doesn’t require credit scores to apply. And you may be able to build your credit with on-time payments since Oportun reports to nationwide credit bureaus (though Oportun doesn’t specify which bureaus it reports to).

Prequalification application — During the prequalification process, Oportun runs a soft credit inquiry, which won’t affect your credit scores. This can help you see what terms you may qualify for, though remember this may change after you formally apply.
Co-applicants may be allowed — If you want to apply with another person, Oportun may approve a co-applicant. Applying with a co-applicant may help you qualify for the loan or receive better terms.
Application requirements — In order to apply, you must have a valid photo ID, provide proof of income, officially verify your address and submit personal references. You don’t need a credit score to qualify.
 Loan amounts and terms — Oportun offers personal loans ranging from $300 to $8,000. (The lender may offer different terms on Credit Karma.)
